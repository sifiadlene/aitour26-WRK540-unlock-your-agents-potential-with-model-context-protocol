## Microsoft Event Attendees

The instructions on this page assume you are attending an event and have access to a pre-configured lab environment. This environment provides an Azure subscription with all the tools and resources needed to complete the workshop.

## Introduction

This workshop is designed to teach you about the Azure AI Agents Service and the associated [SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/ai-projects-readme?context=%2Fazure%2Fai-services%2Fagents%2Fcontext%2Fcontext){:target="_blank"}. It consists of multiple labs, each highlighting a specific feature of the Azure AI Agents Service. The labs are meant to be completed in order, as each one builds on the knowledge and work from the previous lab.

## Select Workshop Programming Language

The workshop is available in both Python and C#. Please make sure to select the language that fits the lab room or preference by using the language selector tabs. Note, don't switch languages mid-workshop.

**Select the language tab that matches your lab room:**

=== "Python"
    The default language for the workshop is set to **Python**.

## Authenticate with Azure

You need to authenticate with Azure so the agent app can access the Azure AI Agents Service and models. Follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window. The terminal app is **pinned** to the Windows 11 taskbar.

        1. Use the **Username** and **TAP (Temporary Access Pass)** found in the **top section** of the **Resources** tab in the lab environment.
        1. Select **Yes, all apps**
        1. Select **Done**

3. Then select the **Default** subscription from the command line, by selecting **Enter**.

4. Leave the terminal window open for the next steps.

## Authenticate with the DevTunnel Service

DevTunnel enables the Azure AI Agents Service to access your local MCP Server during the workshop.

```powershell
devtunnel login
```

!!! note
    You will be prompted to use the account you used for `az login`. Select the account and continue.

Leave the terminal window open for the next steps.

## Open the Workshop

Follow these steps to open the workshop in Visual Studio Code:

    The following command block updates the workshop repository, activates the Python virtual environment, and opens the project in VS Code.

    Copy and paste the following command block to the terminal and press **Enter**.

    ```powershell
    ; cd $HOME\aitour26-WRK540-unlock-your-agents-potential-with-model-context-protocol `
    ; git pull `
    ; .\src\python\workshop\.venv\Scripts\activate `
    ; code .vscode\python-workspace.code-workspace
    ```

    !!! warning "When the project opens in VS Code, two notifications appear in the bottom right corner. Click ✖ to close both notifications."
