## Microsoft Event Attendees

The instructions on this page assume you are attending [Microsoft Event 2025](https://build.microsoft.com/){:target="_blank"} and have access to a pre-configured lab environment. This environment provides an Azure subscription with all the tools and resources needed to complete the workshop.

## Introduction

This workshop is designed to teach you about the Azure AI Agents Service and the associated [SDK](https://learn.microsoft.com/python/api/overview/azure/ai-projects-readme?context=%2Fazure%2Fai-services%2Fagents%2Fcontext%2Fcontext){:target="_blank"}. It consists of multiple labs, each highlighting a specific feature of the Azure AI Agents Service. The labs are meant to be completed in order, as each one builds on the knowledge and work from the previous lab.

## Select Workshop Programming Language

The workshop is available in both Python and C#. Please make sure to select the language that fits the lab room you are in, by using the language selector tabs. Note, don't switch languages mid-workshop.

**Select the language tab that matches your lab room:**

=== "Python"
    The default language for the workshop is set to **Python**.
=== "C#"
    The default language for the workshop is set to **C#**.

## Authenticate with Azure

You need to authenticate with Azure so the agent app can access the Azure AI Agents Service and models. Follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window. The terminal app is **pinned** to the Windows 11 taskbar.

    ![Open the terminal window](../media/windows-taskbar.png){ width="300" }

2. Run the following command to authenticate with Azure:

    ```powershell
    az login
    ```

    !!! note
        You'll be prompted to open a browser link and log in to your Azure account.

        1. A browser window will open automatically, select **Work or school account** and then select **Continue**.

        1. Use the **Username** and **Password** found in the **top section** of the **Resources** tab in the lab environment.

        2. Select **Yes, all apps**

3. Then select the **Default** subscription from the command line, by selecting **Enter**.

4. Once you've logged in, run the following command to assign the **user** role to the resource group:

    ```powershell
    $subId = $(az account show --query id --output tsv) `
    ;$objectId = $(az ad signed-in-user show --query id -o tsv) `
    ; az role assignment create --role "f6c7c914-8db3-469d-8ca1-694a8f32e121" --assignee-object-id $objectId --scope /subscriptions/$subId/resourceGroups/"rg-agent-workshop" --assignee-principal-type 'User'
    ```

5. Leave the terminal window open for the next steps.

## Open the Workshop

Follow these steps to open the workshop in Visual Studio Code:

=== "Python"

      1. From the terminal window, execute the following commands to clone the workshop repository, navigate to the relevant folder, set up a virtual environment, activate it, and install the required packages:

        !!! warning "When the project opens in VS Code, two notifications appear in the bottom right corner. Click ✖ to close both notifications."

=== "C#"

    1. From a terminal window, execute the following commands to clone the workshop repository:

        ```powershell
        git clone https://github.com/microsoft/build-your-first-agent-with-azure-ai-agent-service-workshop.git
        ```

    === "VS Code"

        1. Open the workshop in Visual Studio Code. From the terminal window, run the following command:

            ```powershell
            code build-your-first-agent-with-azure-ai-agent-service-workshop\.vscode\csharp-workspace.code-workspace
            ```

        !!! note "When the project opens in VS Code, a notification will appear in the bottom right corner to install the C# extension. Click **Install** to install the C# extension, as this will provide the necessary features for C# development."

    === "Visual Studio 2022"

        1. Open the workshop in Visual Studio 2022. From the terminal window, run the following command:

            ```powershell
            start build-your-first-agent-with-azure-ai-agent-service-workshop\src\csharp\workshop\AgentWorkshop.sln
            ```

            !!! note "You may be asked what program to open the solution with. Select **Visual Studio 2022**."

## Azure AI Foundry Project Endpoint

Next, we log in to Azure AI Foundry to retrieve the project endpoint, which the agent app uses to connect to the Azure AI Agents Service.

1. Navigate to the [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com){:target="_blank"} website.
2. Select **Sign in** and use the **Username** and **Password** found in the **top section** of the **Resources** tab in the lab environment. Click on the **Username** and **Password** fields to automatically fill in the login details.
    ![Azure credentials](../media/azure-credentials.png){:width="500"}
3. Read the introduction to the Azure AI Foundry and click **Got it**.
4. Navigate to [All Resources](https://ai.azure.com/AllResources){:target="_blank"} to view the list of AI resources that have been pre-provisioned for you.
5. Select the resource name that starts with **aip-** of type **Project**.

    ![Select project](../media/ai-foundry-project.png){:width="500"}

6. Review the introduction guide and click **Close**.
7. From the **Overview** sidebar menu, locate the **Endpoints and keys** -> **Libraries** -> **Azure AI Foundry** section, click the **Copy** icon to copy the **Azure AI Foundry project endpoint**.

=== "Python"

    ## Configure the Workshop

    1. Switch back to the workshop you opened in VS Code.
    2. **Rename** the `.env.sample` file to `.env`.

        - Select the **.env.sample** file in the VS Code **Explorer** panel.
        - Right-click the file and select **Rename**, or press <kbd>F2</kbd>.
        - Change the file name to `.env` and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

    3. Paste the **Project endpoint** you copied from Azure AI Foundry into the `.env` file.

        ```python
        PROJECT_ENDPOINT="<your_project_endpoint>"
        ```

        Your `.env` file should look similar to this but with your project endpoint.

        ```python
        PROJECT_ENDPOINT="<your_project_endpoint>"
        MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="<your_model_deployment_name>"
        DEV_TUNNEL_URL="<your_dev_tunnel_url>"
        ```

    4. Save the `.env` file.

        ```powershell
        $subId = $(az account show --query id --output tsv)
        $rgName = "rg-agent-workshop"
        $aiAccount = "<ai_account_name>" # Replace with the actual AI account name
        $aiProject = "<ai_project_name>" # Replace with the actual AI project name
        $bingConnectionId = "/subscriptions/$subId/resourceGroups/$rgName/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/$aiAccount/projects/$aiProject/connections/groundingwithbingsearch"
